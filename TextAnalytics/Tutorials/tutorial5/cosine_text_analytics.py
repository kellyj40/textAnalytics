Common algorithm types include Supervised learning where the algorithm its self learns to generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. One standard formulation of the supervised learning task is the classification problem will learn: the learner is required to learn (to approximate the behavior of) a function which maps a vector into one of several classes by looking at several input-output examples of the function.",
             "Supervised some others are also now inserted in this one learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function from labeled training data. The training data consist of a set of training examples. In supervised learning, each example is a pair consisting of an input object (typically a vector) and learn a desired output value (also called the supervisory signal). A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples",
             "Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning task of inferring a function to describe hidden structure from unlabeled data (a classification or categorization is not included in the observations). Since the examples given to the learner are unlabeled, there is no evaluation of the accuracy of the structure that is output by the relevant algorithmâ€”which is one way of distinguishing unsupervised learning from supervised learning and reinforcement learning.",

There are two types, Supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques, where the algorithm generates a function that maps inputs to desired outputs. One standard formulation of the supervised task is the classification problem. Unsupervised learning which models a set of tasks: labeled examples are not available at the moment.",

Common algorithm types include Supervised learning and unsupervised learning techniques, where the algorithm generates a function that will map inputs to desired outputs or related results. One standard formulation of the supervised learning task is the classification problem of seperation.
