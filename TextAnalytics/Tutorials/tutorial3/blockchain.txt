Bitcoin may be the best-known application of the blockchain, but it’s just the start. Others already developed include Ethereum, a decentralised platform for smart contracts that run as programmed, without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.UK-based Everledger creates blockchain-based solutions to help banks, insurances and open marketplaces to reduce incidences of fraud. This ledger tracks and protects valuable assets, collecting each one’s defining characteristics, history and ownership to create a permanent record on the blockchain. This digital incarnation, or thumbprint, is used by various stakeholders across a supply chain pipeline to verify provenance and authenticity.Just like Bitcoin, these apps run on a custom-built blockchain – a shared global infrastructure that can move value around with, so its proponents argue, total transparency.Whether it is to create markets, store registries of debts and promises, or move funds in accordance to instructions, the blockchain can execute everything from someone’s last will and testament to futures contracts to proof of ownership of a house. It is a single source of truth that does away with the need for a middleman.
Referred to as the second generation of the internet, all this disintermediation presents a revolutionary opportunity to get a whole range of things done with vastly reduced complexity – and at significantly reduced cost.
The implications for payments are clear as well. At present, one of the core functions of a bank is to act as a clearinghouse for the execution of payments. What the blockchain offers is a way to do away with all transactions that involve mirror entities, such as bank reconciliations, which would help to lower costs and reduce the risk of money laundering.The technology provides for new kinds of payments in the construction industry, with large, consortia-based projects run on the basis of all parties having accurate, up-to-date, verifiable information in relation to the supply of various construction processes and the execution of staged payments.
